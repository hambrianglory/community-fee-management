# 🎉 MEMBER TAB EDIT FUNCTIONALITY - COMPLETE SOLUTION

## Issues Fixed

### ❌ **Original Problems:**
1. **No role change option** - Users couldn't change member ↔ admin roles

#### 2. **Active Status Control**  
- Added checkbox: **"Active Member"**
- Located in the "Member" column when editing
- Allows enabling/disabling member accounts

#### 3. **Fixed Text Visibility**

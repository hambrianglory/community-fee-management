- **Authentication**: Valid access token
- **Message Sending**: API returns 200 OK with message IDs
- **Phone Number ID**: Active and accessible
- **Quality Rating**: GREEN (excellent)

## Issue: Messages Sent But Not Received 📱

Based on our investigation, the API is working correctly but messages may not be delivered due to **WhatsApp Business API restrictions**.

## Most Likely Causes 🔍

### 1. **Sandbox Mode** (Most Common)
- Your WhatsApp Business API is likely in **sandbox/development mode**
- In sandbox mode, only **verified test phone numbers** can receive messages
- Messages to unverified numbers will show as "sent" but won't be delivered

**Solution:**
- Log into Facebook Developer Console
- Go to your app → WhatsApp → API Setup
- Add test phone numbers in the "Phone numbers" section
- Or move to production mode (requires business verification)

### 2. **Business Verification Required**
- Full WhatsApp Business API requires business verification
- Without verification, delivery is limited

**Solution:**
- Complete business verification in Facebook Business Manager
- This may take several days to approve

### 3. **Message Template Requirements**
- Some types of content require approved message templates
- Promotional or marketing messages especially need templates

**Solution:**
- Create and get approval for message templates
- Use templates for community announcements

## Immediate Actions Required 🚀

# GitHub Upload Guide - Community Fee Management

## 🚀 Quick GitHub Upload Steps

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository
1. Go to: **https://github.com/new**
2. **Repository name**: `community-fee-management`
3. **Visibility**: Make it **PUBLIC** (required for free Netlify)
4. **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license
5. Click **"Create repository"**

### Step 2: Upload Your Code
After creating the repository, run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Remove any existing remote (if needed)
git remote remove origin

# Add your GitHub repository as remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/community-fee-management.git

# Set main branch
git branch -M main

# Upload to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 3: Verify Upload
1. Go to your repository: `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/community-fee-management`
2. You should see all your files uploaded
3. Check that these key files are present:
   - `package.json`
   - `netlify.toml`
   - `next.config.ts`
   - `src/` folder with all your code

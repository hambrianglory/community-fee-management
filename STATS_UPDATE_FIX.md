# Overview Stats Update Fix - Summary

## Issue Identified
The overview statistics (specifically "Total Members" count) were not updating when members were deleted from the Members tab. This caused inconsistency between the actual member count and the displayed statistics.

## Root Cause
The `handleDeleteMember` function was updating the members array and filtered members array, but was not updating the stats state that drives the Overview tab statistics display.

## Fix Applied
Added stats update logic to the `handleDeleteMember` function to ensure the overview statistics reflect the current member count after deletions.

### Code Change
```typescript
// Update stats with new member count
setStats(prev => prev ? {
  ...prev,
  totalMembers: updatedMembers.length
} : null);
```

## Verification
The fix ensures that:
- ✅ When a member is deleted, the overview "Total Members" count decreases by 1
- ✅ Multiple deletions continue to update the count accurately
- ✅ The stats remain consistent with the actual member list
- ✅ Other stats values (collected, expenses, balance) are preserved

## Consistency Check
This fix follows the same pattern already used in:
- `handleSaveNewMember` (add member function)
- `loadData` (initial data loading)
- File upload processing

## Testing
1. Go to Admin Panel → Overview tab
2. Note the current "Total Members" count
3. Switch to Members tab
4. Delete a member and confirm
5. Return to Overview tab
6. Verify the count has decreased by 1
7. Test with multiple deletions to confirm continued accuracy

## Impact
- **User Experience**: Overview statistics now accurately reflect member operations
- **Data Integrity**: Consistent member count across all admin panel tabs
- **Real-time Updates**: Statistics update immediately after member deletion
- **No Breaking Changes**: All other functionality remains unchanged

The admin panel now provides accurate, real-time statistics that stay synchronized with member management operations.

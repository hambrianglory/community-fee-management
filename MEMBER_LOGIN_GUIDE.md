# Member Login System - Updated Guide

## 🔐 Authentication System Overview

Your Community Fee Management System now supports two types of login:

### 👨‍💼 Admin Login
- **Email**: admin@hambriangLory.com
- **Password**: Admin@2025
- **Access**: Full admin panel with all features

### 👥 Member Login  
- **Email**: Member's registered email address
- **Password**: Member's NIC number (temporary password)
- **Access**: Member dashboard with personal information

## 🆕 What's Been Fixed

### ✅ **Member Authentication Issue Resolved**

**Problem**: Members couldn't login because no password was set during member creation.

**Solution**: 
1. **Auto-Password Setup**: When adding a member, their NIC number is automatically set as their temporary password
2. **Flexible Authentication**: The system now accepts NIC numbers as valid passwords for members
3. **Clear Instructions**: Login page shows examples for both admin and member login

### 🔧 **Technical Changes Made**

1. **Member Creation (`src/app/admin/page.tsx`)**:
   ```tsx
   const newMember: User = {
     // ... other fields
     password: addMemberForm.nicNumber!, // NIC as temporary password
   };
   ```

2. **Authentication Logic (`src/lib/localDatabase.ts`)**:
   ```tsx
   // For members, allow login with NIC number as password
   if (user.role === 'member' && user.nicNumber && password === user.nicNumber) {
     isValidPassword = true;
   }
   ```

3. **Login Instructions (`src/app/login/page.tsx`)**:
   - Added helpful login instructions box
   - Shows examples for both admin and member login
   - Clear visual distinction between user types

## 📋 **How to Test Member Login**

## 🎯 **Security Notes**

1. **Temporary Passwords**: Member NIC numbers are temporary passwords
2. **Password Change**: Members should change their password after first login
3. **Account Lockout**: 5 failed attempts lock account for 30 minutes
4. **Admin Override**: Admins can reset member passwords to NIC numbers

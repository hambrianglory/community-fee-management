- **Search Fields**: 
  - Member name
  - Email address
  - Phone number
  - NIC number
  - House number
  - Role (member/admin)
- **User Experience**: Type-as-you-search with instant results

- **Implementation**: Individual delete button for each member
- **Safety**: Confirmation dialog before deletion
- **Feedback**: Success message after deletion
- **Edge Cases**: Handles deletion of currently edited member
- **Technical**: Proper state management for both members and filteredMembers

## Technical Implementation

### Search Implementation
```tsx
// State management
const [searchTerm, setSearchTerm] = useState('');
const [filteredMembers, setFilteredMembers] = useState<User[]>([]);

// Real-time filtering
useEffect(() => {
  if (!searchTerm.trim()) {
    setFilteredMembers(members);
  } else {
    const filtered = members.filter(member =>
      member.name.toLowerCase().includes(searchTerm.toLowerCase()) ||
      member.email.toLowerCase().includes(searchTerm.toLowerCase()) ||
      member.phone.includes(searchTerm) ||
      member.nicNumber.toLowerCase().includes(searchTerm.toLowerCase()) ||
      (member.houseNumber && member.houseNumber.toLowerCase().includes(searchTerm.toLowerCase())) ||
      member.role.toLowerCase().includes(searchTerm.toLowerCase())
    );
    setFilteredMembers(filtered);
  }
}, [members, searchTerm]);
```

### Delete Implementation
```tsx
const handleDeleteMember = (memberId: string, memberName: string) => {
  if (window.confirm(`Are you sure you want to delete member "${memberName}"? This action cannot be undone.`)) {
    const updatedMembers = members.filter(member => member.id !== memberId);
    setMembers(updatedMembers);
    setFilteredMembers(updatedMembers.filter(member =>
      // Apply current search filter to updated list
    ));
    
    // Handle edge case: cancel edit if deleting currently edited member
    if (editingMember === memberId) {
      setEditingMember(null);
      setEditForm({});
    }
    
    alert(`Member "${memberName}" has been deleted successfully.`);
  }
};
```
